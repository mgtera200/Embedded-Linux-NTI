# Task Description and Solution Overview

## Task Description

### Assignment Overview

- **Objective**: 
  - Develop a C program to implement a binary search algorithm.

### Objectives

- **Binary Search Implementation**: 
  - Write a C program that implements the binary search algorithm to find the index of a given key in a sorted array.

## Solution Approach

### Implementation Approach

- **Binary Search Function**: 
  - Implement a binary search algorithm in C to efficiently find the index of a given key in a sorted array.
- **Main Function**: 
  - Create an array with sorted elements and define a key to search for.
  - Call the binary search function with the array and key parameters.
- **Result Printing**: 
  - Print the index of the key after the binary search operation.

### Features of the Code

- **Binary Search Function**: 
  - Efficiently searches a sorted array using the binary search algorithm.
- **Main Function**: 
  - Demonstrates the usage of the binary search function by initializing an array and defining a key.
- **Result Printing**: 
  - Outputs the index of the key if found, or a message indicating that the key is not present in the array.

### Code Structure

- The C program consists of a binary search function and a main function.
- The binary search function takes an array, its size, and a key to search for, and returns the index of the key if found.
- The main function initializes an array with sorted elements, defines a key, calls the binary search function, and prints the result.
