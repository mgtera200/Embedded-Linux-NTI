# Customized ARM Toolchain

## Overview:
This task documents the configuration and setup of a customized ARM toolchain using Crosstool-NG.

It includes explanations of the sysroot directory structure and binutils components, providing insights into the essential components of cross-compilation toolchains.

The configured toolchain targets the arm-cortexa9-neon-linux-eabihf architecture, providing support for the Musl library, Make, and Strace utilities.

## Toolchain Configuration:
The ARM toolchain was configured using Crosstool-NG with the following steps:

1. **Bootstrap**: To set up the environment.
2. **Configure**: Checked all dependencies with `./configure --enable-local`.
3. **Make**: Generated the Makefile for Crosstool-NG.
4. **List Samples**: Listed all supported microcontrollers with `./ct-ng list-samples`.
5. **Configuration**: Configured the desired microcontroller with `./ct-ng [microcontroller]`.
6. **Menuconfig**: Configured the toolchain options using `./ct-ng menuconfig`.
7. **Build**: Built the toolchain with `./ct-ng build`.

## Sysroot Explanation:
A sysroot serves as the root filesystem for the target system during cross-compilation. It contains all necessary files and libraries required to build and run software for the target architecture.

- **Sysroot Directory Structure**: 
  - `/usr/lib`: Contains necessary shared libraries (*.so) for dynamically linking executables, as well as static libraries (*.a) if statically linking.
  - `/etc`: Holds system configuration files required by the software being built.
  - `/lib`: May include additional shared libraries or kernel-essential system libraries.
  - `/usr/include`: Typically holds header files (*.h) for compilation compatibility.
  - `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, etc.: Contain executable files required by the software being built.
  - Other directories may exist based on the specific requirements of the target system or software being developed.

- **Target System Requirements**:
  - The sysroot should include all necessary files, libraries, and configuration settings required for the target system to run the software.
  - It should mirror the directory structure and essential files present on the target system to ensure compatibility and proper functioning.

## Binutil Explanation:
Binutils are a collection of binary utilities, including programs for assembling, linking, and manipulating binary files for various architectures. They are essential components of a toolchain, providing the necessary tools to create executable files and libraries.

- **Usage**: Binutils are typically invoked during the build process to assemble source code, link object files, and create executable binaries or libraries.
- **Components**: Binutils include programs such as `as` (assembler), `ld` (linker), `ar` (archive), `objdump` (object file disassembler), and `nm` (symbol table viewer), among others.
- **Cross-Compilation**: Binutils can be configured and built to target specific architectures, enabling cross-compilation for different platforms.

## Conclusion:
By customizing the ARM toolchain and understanding the sysroot and binutils, developers can create efficient and optimized software for ARM-based embedded systems. This setup enables seamless cross-compilation, ensuring compatibility and performance for target devices.
