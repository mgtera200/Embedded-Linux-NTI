# Task Description

## Assignment Overview

- **Objective**: 
  - Develop a Bash script to automate environment variable management and terminal operations.

## Objectives

- **Script Functionality**: 
  - The script checks for the existence of the `.bashrc` file in the user's home directory.
  - If the file exists, it appends two environment variables to it: `HELLO` with the value of `HOSTNAME`, and `LOCAL` with the output of the `whoami` command.
  - Finally, the script launches a new terminal window.

## Implementation Approach

- **Script Design**: 
  - The script meticulously handles file existence checks and environment variable manipulation to ensure robustness and reliability.
  - It leverages standard Bash commands and utilities for seamless execution across different environments.

## Terminal Behavior Analysis

- **Upon Terminal Opening**: 
  - The script's execution results in the successful creation of the `HELLO` and `LOCAL` environment variables.
