# Creating a Pseudo Character Device Driver in Linux Kernel

## Introduction
This guide explains how to create a pseudo character device driver in the Linux kernel. The driver will allow users to interact with the device through a device file in `/dev`, storing and appending data that can be read back.

## Step 1: Define Device File Operations
- Create `file_operations.h` to define the device file operations.
- Implement functions for opening, closing, reading, and writing to the device.

## Step 2: Implement Driver Logic
- Create `file_operations.c` to implement the device driver logic.
- Define a buffer to store data and handle read and write operations accordingly.

## Step 3: Main Driver Initialization
- Implement `main.c` to initialize the driver and register it with the kernel.
- Define the device name, class name, and other necessary structures.
- Use `alloc_chrdev_region` to allocate device numbers dynamically.
- Initialize a `struct cdev` object representing the character device.
- Register the character device with the kernel using `cdev_add`.
- Create a device class with `class_create`.
- Create the device file in `/dev` using `device_create`.

## Step 4: Makefile
- Create a `Makefile` to compile the driver modules.
- Specify the source files and dependencies.
- Use the `obj-m` and `obj-y` variables to specify which modules to build.

## Step 5: Compilation and Installation
- Run `make` to compile the driver modules.
- Install the driver modules using `insmod`.
- Verify successful installation with `lsmod` and `dmesg`.

## Step 6: Testing
- Use `echo` to write data to the device file (`/dev/your_device`).
- Use `cat` to read data from the device file and verify correct behavior.
- Ensure data is appended on subsequent writes and displayed on reads.

## Step 7: Cleanup
- Unload the driver modules using `rmmod`.
- Remove the device file from `/dev`.
- Clean up any allocated resources.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create a custom character device driver in the Linux kernel and interact with it through the `/dev` filesystem. This provides a flexible mechanism for storing and retrieving data from user space applications.
