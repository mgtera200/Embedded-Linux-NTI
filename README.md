# NTI Tasks Repository

Welcome to the NTI Tasks Repository!

This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of the tasks completed during my 4-month National Telecommunication Institute (NTI) program. Each task is meticulously documented, providing detailed insights into the main assignment requirements and my approach to solving them.

For each task completed during the NTI program, you'll find a separate file or directory with a descriptive name. Each task includes:
- Task name or number.
- Description of the task.
- Specific instructions or requirements.
- Approach to completing the task.
